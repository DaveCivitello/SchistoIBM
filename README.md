## Overview    

Individual-based model (IBM) for schistosome parasite and snail host population interactions based on dynamic energy budget (DEB) and transmission model. Model outlines how resource use by a size-structured host population influences population cycles of hosts and parasites. Host and parasite ecology and energetics are captured using a mechanistic energy budget model and interactions among hosts and parasites are captured by a disease tranmission model. Resource use by hosts and thus parasites is captured by the IBM.
